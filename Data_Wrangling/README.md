## Data Wrangling


Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is an iterative process that involves 
data exploration, transformation, 
validation, and making data available for a credible and meaningful analysis

- **Structuring**: change the form and schema of your data.
 - **Normalization** and **denormalization** of data: normalization focuses on leaning the database of unused data and reducing redundancy and inconsistency
 - **Cleaning**: fix irregularities in data in order to produce a credible and accurate analysis.

**R** <img src="R.png" alt="R" style="width:80px;"/>


 offers a series of libraries and packages that are explicitly 
 created for wrangling messy data.
 Using these libraries, you can investigate, manipulate, and analyze data.
Libraries:

- **Dplyr**: a powerful library for data wrangling. It has a precise and straightforward syntax
