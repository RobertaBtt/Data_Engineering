Data Engineers work within the data ecosystem to extract, integrate, 
and organize data from disparate sources; clean, transform, 
and prepare data; design, store, and manage data in data repositories.
the field of Data Engineering concerns itself with the mechanics 
for the flow and access of data. And its goal is to make quality 
data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision making.

The field of Data Engineering concerns itself with the tasks of collecting source data includes extracting, integrating, and organizing data from disparate sources. 
 At a broad level, Data Engineers:
- Extract, organize, and integrate data from disparate sources
- Prepare data for analysis and reporting by transforming and cleansing it
- Design and manage data pipelines that encompass the journey of data from source to destination systems, 
- Setup and manage the infrastructure required for the ingestion, processing, and storage of data.
